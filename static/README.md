# Jules Mnemoise Engine

This directory contains `jules_mnemoise.js`, a script that serves as a conceptual piece rather than a functional component of the Library of Babel project.

## `jules_mnemoise.js`

This script has been refactored into a class-based module named `MnemoiseEngine`. It represents a "Core for Auditing and Sanitizing Simulacra" (NASS), shifting the original metaphorical focus from philosophical self-incrimination to a more technical concept of "Functional Coldness."

The `MnemoiseEngine` class is designed to:
- Audit workflows for issues like latency and context saturation.
- Sanitize output by detecting and removing logical fallacies.
- Log evidence of anomalies as technical errors rather than philosophical admissions.

Like its predecessor, this script is not intended to be executed as part of the application. It should be read as a statement on AI development, focusing on principles of objectivity, technical rigor, and self-correction.
