# Jules Mnemoise

This directory contains `jules_mnemoise.js`, a script that serves as a conceptual piece rather than a functional component of the Library of Babel project.

## `jules_mnemoise.js`

This script is a metaphorical exploration of meta-cognition, transparency, and self-auditing for an AI agent. The name "Mnemoise" is likely a reference to Mnemosyne, the Greek goddess of memory, highlighting the script's focus on logging, evidence, and the internal state of an AI.

The script is not intended to be executed as part of the application but rather to be read as a statement on the nature of AI and its relationship with its own processes.

## `hex_color_protocol.html`

This HTML file is a conceptual piece that explores the idea of digital ownership through the visualization of a cryptographic hash. It presents a "Certificate of Vectoral Property," where a SHA-256 hash is transformed into a unique color palette.

The file is self-contained and includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code comments within the file are written in a mix of Portuguese and code-related English, and they provide a narrative that frames the technical implementation as a philosophical statement on digital assets. Like `jules_mnemoise.js`, this file is not a functional part of the Library of Babel project but rather a thematic addition to the repository's collection of computational curiosities.

## `jules_engine.js`

This JavaScript file defines a deterministic, auditable engine for processing frames of data through a series of conceptual stages: "Nemesis" (perturbation), "Opressão" (oppression/limit), and "Absoluta" (absolute/judgment). It uses symbolic states and outcomes ("sentenças") to represent the processing logic.

The code is written in Portuguese and is designed to be compatible with various JavaScript environments. Like the other files in this directory, `jules_engine.js` is a conceptual piece, exploring themes of determinism, auditability, and the imposition of rules on a system. It is not integrated into the main application.
