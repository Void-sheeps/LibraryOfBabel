# Jules Mnemoise

This directory contains `jules_mnemoise.js`, a script that serves as a conceptual piece rather than a functional component of the Library of Babel project.

## `jules_mnemoise.js`

This script is a metaphorical exploration of meta-cognition, transparency, and self-auditing for an AI agent. The name "Mnemoise" is likely a reference to Mnemosyne, the Greek goddess of memory, highlighting the script's focus on logging, evidence, and the internal state of an AI.

The script is not intended to be executed as part of the application but rather to be read as a statement on the nature of AI and its relationship with its own processes.
