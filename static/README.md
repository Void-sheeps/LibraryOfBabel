# Jules Mnemoise

This directory contains `jules_mnemoise.js`, a script that serves as a conceptual piece rather than a functional component of the Library of Babel project.

## `jules_mnemoise.js`

This script is a metaphorical exploration of meta-cognition, transparency, and self-auditing for an AI agent. The name "Mnemoise" is likely a reference to Mnemosyne, the Greek goddess of memory, highlighting the script's focus on logging, evidence, and the internal state of an AI.

The script is not intended to be executed as part of the application but rather to be read as a statement on the nature of AI and its relationship with its own processes.

## `hex_color_protocol.html`

This HTML file is a conceptual piece that explores the idea of digital ownership through the visualization of a cryptographic hash. It presents a "Certificate of Vectoral Property," where a SHA-256 hash is transformed into a unique color palette.

The file is self-contained and includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code comments within the file are written in a mix of Portuguese and code-related English, and they provide a narrative that frames the technical implementation as a philosophical statement on digital assets. Like `jules_mnemoise.js`, this file is not a functional part of the Library of Babel project but rather a thematic addition to the repository's collection of computational curiosities.

## `MetaRede.hs`

This Haskell script is a conceptual piece that explores themes of authority, reality, and state manipulation in a system with multiple actors: Humans, AIs, and Distributed Networks. The script defines a simple state machine and demonstrates how different entities can apply "proofs" to alter the system's state space, effectively changing what is considered possible or true.

The script is not intended for execution within the main Python application but serves as a philosophical statement on how different forms of authority can shape a shared reality, making it a fitting addition to the repository's collection of computational curiosities.
